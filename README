/*************************
 * MiCandy -- A sweeter, more powerful way to record superior sound on .NET with the powerful Kinect Sensor
 *************************

This is s successful extension of the tutorial given to me and others by Clint Rutkas who runs Coding4Fun.com
at the Imagine Cup Finals. I decide to prettify the audo example and make it into a real usable app for the 
average desktop user. I use it not to record any weird sounds i wish :-)

Try it, use it, extend it, share the damn thing!
